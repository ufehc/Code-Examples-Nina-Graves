Hello Wil, 

as mentioned here some code examples. Unfortunately, the youngest of this code is 1.5 years old. As mentioned I have done a lot more coding at work especially in the last few months, so I guess my coding has also developed since - but hopefully only to the better ;) Nonetheless, I think this does represents what I try looking out for when coding. 
You can find the following uni projects here:


### Regression_Trees_Pisa_Daten 
This was a seminar in which each team of 3 people was assigned an algorithm to predict pisa scores. Unluckily at the 
time, extremely good for me in retrospect, I was the "data and coding person" in the team (I won't pretend you don't know how these
group assignments work), so all code except for "Modeling.ipynb" "functions_models_weltbank.py" and "prepare_WB.py" is 
mine. I can tell you: this was by far the project where I learned most. 
For some reason we thought it would be a good idea to compensate the little amount of data to learn from, by bombarding 
the algorithms with features. :D
We had that much data, that I ran our code on a more powerful virtual server I had access to with a lot more RAM and CPU 
than my local machine. I think it had 12 cores, so tha helped a lot worth hyper-parameter optimisation. To be able to 
analyse the results properly, and I had functions for some standardised outputs for the modelruns. HOWEVER (!!), 
unfortunately, we completely blew the assignment. The supervisors initially only wanted a 
jupyter notebook with our code. But after we told them we worked with a lot more data than anticipated, they also accepted 
more than just one notebook, if we created a notebook with a basic overview and all modelling scripts included all code 
we used for evaluation. So, please feel free to judge my modularity for the data preparation, but please don't do so for
that massive "copy-paste"-block in the models.

### Default_Predictions_ML_Algorithms
More of the "expected" Data Science code than that first seminar - I certainly learned that if a jupyter is requested 
then people really do not want a lot of code and a lot of structure. This is another shared project in which we were 
supposed to do some default prediction and we were explicitly told what algorithms to use - basically "try everything 
once". I must admit, this projcet is certainly not my proudest hour, but I thought it's only fair to include that as well. 


### Agent-based
These are the first two exercises I handed in for my course on agent-based modelling and learning baysean networks. 
Unfortunately, my hand-in of the last exercise (and by far the most exciting!) in which I actually implemented the 
learning baysean network unfortunetely is no longer available to me. In these exercises we received a code sceleton we 
were asked to complete. Hence, the majority of code in the folder "restaurant" is mine and nearly all code in 
"fraud_detection" is mine. If I remember correctly, at least some of the tests for the "restaurant" exercise are mine as well, 
but I couldn't sware to it.

Cheers,
Nina
